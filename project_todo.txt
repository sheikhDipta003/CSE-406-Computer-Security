Project Scope:

You need to thoroughly investigate the features and the source code of the assigned tools. If the scope of the assigned tool is too large, please contact your assigned supervisor to limit the scope of the features. Then, you need to run the tool in a virtual environment (Cloud VM or Local VM, or Docker). If the tool is open source, you have to understand the source code at a high level. There is no need to understand the nitty-gritty details of the source code. Just get an overview and an idea of the implementation. You have to submit a report on the tool. There will be a presentation session where you will demonstrate the key features of the tool.

Report Structure:

Overview of the tool or framework
An overview of the source code (If publicly available)
Features' short description
Documentation to run each feature You must document each feature in such detail that anyone can run the feature on his own, following your documentation. (Give snapshots of each step.)
Snapshots of the demonstration of each feature
Youtube unlisted video link of the demonstration of the features.
You must use latex for the report
You have to submit the latex source code and pdf of the report in Moodle.
